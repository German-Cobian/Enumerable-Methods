In the project we have replicated our own version of the following methods; 
- each, 
- each_with_index, 
- select, 
- all, 
- any, 
- none, 
- inject, 
- map using Ruby programming language.

## How to get Rspec Running
- Run the following command in the terminal
    gem install rspec
- This command installs Rspec on your computer. You ensure that Rspec is installed by running the following command to see the installed version
    rspec --version
- You should get output similar to the following:
    RSpec 3.10
      rspec-core 3.10.1
      rspec-expectations 3.10.1
      rspec-mocks 3.10.2
      rspec-support 3.10.2
- The rspec gem comes packed with all we need to get started including the 5 gems listed above.
- Navigagte into the AdvancedBuildingBlocks-Enumerables folder
    cd AdvancedBuildingBlocks-Enumerables
- Run the following command to initialize Rspec
    rspec --init
- This generates a /spec folder and a .rspec file at the root of your project
- Finally, to run the tests, simple run:
    rspec
