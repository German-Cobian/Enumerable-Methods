In the project we have replicated our own version of the following methods; 
* each,
* each_with_index, 
* select, 
* all, 
* any, 
* none, 
* inject, 
* map using Ruby programming language. 


## Built With

* Ruby programming language


## Getting Started

- To run this program on your local machine, simply follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
* Install the ruby programming language.

### Usage

* Clone this repo on your local machine by running:
      git clonehttps://github.com/German-Cobian/Enumerable-Methods.git
- cd into the folder you just cloned.
- run ruby enumerables.rb.

### Testing with Rspec
  This project is tested with Rspec which is a computer domain-specific language (DSL) testing tool written in the Ruby programming language.

### How to get Rspec Running
* Run the following command in the terminal:
    gem install rspec
* This command installs Rspec on your computer. You ensure that Rspec is installed by running the following command to see the installed version:
    rspec --version
* You should get output similar to the following:
    RSpec 3.10
      rspec-core 3.10.1
      rspec-expectations 3.10.1
      rspec-mocks 3.10.2
      rspec-support 3.10.2
* The rspec gem comes packed with all you need to get started including the 5 gems listed above.
* Navigate into the AdvancedBuildingBlocks-Enumerables folder:
    cd AdvancedBuildingBlocks-Enumerables
* Run the following command to initialize Rspec:
    rspec --init
* This generates a /spec folder and a .rspec file at the root of your project.
* Finally, to run the tests, simply run:
    rspec
