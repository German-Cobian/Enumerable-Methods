In the project we have replicated our own version of the following methods: 
* each,
* each_with_index, 
* select, 
* all, 
* any, 
* none, 
* inject, 
* map 


## Built With

* Ruby programming language


## Getting Started

To run this program on your local machine, simply follow the steps below:


### Prerequisites
* Install the ruby programming language.

### Usage
* Clone this repo on your local machine by running `git clonehttps://github.com/German-Cobian/Enumerable-Methods.git`
* `cd` into the `Enumerable-Methods` folder you just cloned.
* run `ruby enumerables.rb`


### Testing with Rspec
  This project is tested with Rspec which is a computer domain-specific language (DSL) testing tool written in the Ruby programming language.

### How to get Rspec Running
* Run the following command in the terminal: `gem install rspec`
* This command installs Rspec on your computer. You ensure that Rspec is installed by running the following command to see the installed version: `rspec --version`
* You should get output similar to the following:
  ```
  RSpec 3.10
    - rspec-core 3.10.1
    - rspec-expectations 3.10.1
    - rspec-mocks 3.10.2
    - rspec-support 3.10.2
  ```
* The rspec gem comes packed with all you need to get started including the 5 gems listed above.
* Navigate into the requisite folder by running `cd AdvancedBuildingBlocks-Enumerables`
* Run the following command to initialize Rspec: `rspec --init`
* This generates a /spec folder and a .rspec file at the root of your project.
* Finally, to run the tests, simply run `rspec`
